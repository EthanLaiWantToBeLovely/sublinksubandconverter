# 不放心release文件可以自己打包,python版本不建议使用3.11以及更新的版本，否则可能不兼容
# windows建议直接运行py，否则运行速度很慢

# If you're not comfortable with the release file, you can package it yourself. It's not recommended to use Python version 3.11 or later, otherwise incompatibility may occur.

# On Windows, it's recommended to run the .py file directly; otherwise, the execution speed will be very slow.
